# Geospatial Project – Francesco Di Massimo

Urban walkability can be understood and measured in many different ways, making the concept itself somewhat difficult to define. A walkable place might be characterized by a dense street network, or by the availability of a wide range of services within walking distance.

Other factors — such as the **morphological characteristics** of the urban landscape — can also significantly influence both **walkability** and **bikeability**, especially in hilly or uneven environments like Rome.

In this project, I aim to evaluate the **walkability and bikeability of the city of Rome** by analyzing a set of spatial metrics and combining them into a **composite accessibility index**. The objective is to identify which areas of the city are more — or less — accessible by walking and cycling, in order to inform future planning and mobility strategies.
