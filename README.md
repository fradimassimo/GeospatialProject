Urban walkability can be understood and measured in many different ways. Because of this, the term is difficult to define. To say a place is walkable could for example mean that the network of streets is dense or that a wide selection of services is accessible on foot. 

Here I will try to evaluate the walkability and bikeability of the city of Rome by analyzing multiple spatial metrics and combining them into a final composite index. The goal is to identify areas that are more or less accessible by walking and cycling.
